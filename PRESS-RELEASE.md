# Dog Surfing #
 
## Community Pet Care ##
  > Owning a pet can be expensive and time consuming. Having a community makes things easier for you and better for your pet.

## Pet Lovers Unite ##
  > This is for the busy pet parent who wants to make sure their furry friend is getting enough exercise and care when life happens 
  and for the pet lovers who want to spend more time with dogs without the long term commitment.

## Summary ##
  > It takes a village to raise a child, but what about a dog? Many times it's unrealistic to travel with a pet, but kennels are an 
  unfamiliar setting and booking a pet sitter is cost prohibitive. Or maybe you don't have time to fully commit to a pet of your own, 
  but you would love to spend a weekend cuddling with a furry couch potato. Wouldn't it be great to find a friend to head to the park
  with who has a dog that can finally wear out your puppy? This is where Dog Surfing comes in. We create connections between pet lovers 
  and allow them to help each other out by opening up their home and hearts to furry couch surfers.

## Problem ##
  > Traveling is expensive enough without worrying about the cost of making sure your furry friends are comfortable while you're away.

## Solution ##
  > Dog surfing puts you in touch with a community of pet lovers who will take care of your animal as if it were their own.
